# In-Vehicle Coupon Recommendation – CIS 412 Final Project

This repository contains the full deployment package for our CIS 412 final project, including:

- A **Streamlit web application** that predicts whether a driver will accept an in-vehicle coupon  
- The **dataset** used to train the model  
- Our **Jupyter notebook** with exploratory analysis and model development  
- Our **presentation slide deck**

The Streamlit app allows a user (professor) to plug in scenario details—destination, passenger type, weather, time of day, coupon category, driving distance, and more—and receive both a **prediction (accept/reject)** and **probability score**.  
This satisfies the project deployment requirement and provides a fully interactive demo.

## Project Overview

The objective of this project was to analyze factors that influence drivers’ decisions to accept in-vehicle coupons and use classification models to predict acceptance.

We:

1. Performed data cleaning and exploratory analysis  
2. Tested several machine learning models  
3. Selected and deployed the final model using Streamlit  
4. Built an interactive app for input-based predictions  

The result is a fully working deployment where any instructor or user can modify parameters and instantly see model outputs.
